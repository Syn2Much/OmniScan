## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Adding Custom Modules

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend functionality:

```python
# Example: Create custom_scanner.py
class CustomScanner:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
    
    def custom_scan(self):
        # Your custom scanning logic
        return {"result": "data"}

# Import in main.py
from custom_scanner import CustomScanner

# Add to menu and integrate
```

### Automation with Scripts

```python
from web_analyzer import WebAnalyzer

# Automated scanning
targets = ["https://site1.com", "https://site2.com"]
for target in targets:
    analyzer = WebAnalyzer(target)
    result = analyzer.full_recon_scan()
    # Process results
```

- Use for malicious purposes
- Violate computer fraud laws
- Cause service disruption

**Users are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.**

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Default timeout: 10 seconds
- Port scanning may trigger IDS/IPS alerts
- Consider rate limiting for batch scans

### Data Privacy
- Scan results may contain sensitive information
- Store results securely
- Comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)

### Operational Security
- Use VPN when testing remote systems
- Obtain written authorization before testing
- Maintain audit logs of scanning activities

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** DNS resolution errors
```
Solution: Check internet connectivity and DNS settings
Verify target hostname is correct
```

**Issue:** SSL certificate errors
```
Solution: Target may not support HTTPS
Check firewall/proxy settings
```

**Issue:** Port scanning fails
```
Solution: Firewall may be blocking connections
Increase timeout in configuration
Some ports may require elevated privileges
```

**Issue:** Permission denied errors
```
Solution: Run with appropriate permissions
Some operations (port < 1024) may require sudo/admin
```
